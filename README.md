# EXFOR-CLIENT

**EXFOR-CLIENT** is the frontend application for a larger fan project inspired by the *Expeditionary Force* book series by Craig Alanson. It connects with a companion backend service found here: [EXFOR-Server](https://github.com/DonovanOLinn/EXFOR-Server).

This client is built using React and bootstrapped with Vite for fast development.
